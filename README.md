# GifsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

It's a basic gif search app that uses the Giphy API to search gifs. It was built thinking about modularity, component reusability and bootstrap for sytling. The user has a a history tab where they can see their 10 most recent searches so they can easily get to back to what they are looking for; these get stored in the local storage, however, it would be best to use session storage.
